## CPU Power Management

* CPU power management is done by `CPUFriend.kext` while `CPUFriendDataProvider.kext` defines how it should be done. `CPUFriendDataProvider.kext` is generated for a specific CPU and power setting. The one supplied in this repository was made for the i7-12700F. In case you have another CPU, you should follow [this guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/universal/pm.html) to generate your own `CPUFriendDataProvider.kext`.

## iService

* To use iMessage and other Apple services, you need to generate your own serial numbers. This can be done using [CorpNewt's GenSMBIOS](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS). Make sure model is `iMacPro1,1`. Then, go [Apple Check Coverage page](https://checkcoverage.apple.com/) to check your generated serial numbers. If the website tells you that the serial number **is not valid**, that is fine. Otherwise, you have to generate a new set.

* Next you will have to copy the following values to your `config.plist`:
  - Serial Number -> `PlatformInfo/Generic/SystemSerialNumber`.
  - Board Number -> `PlatformInfo/Generic/MLB`.
  - SmUUID -> `/PlatformInfo/Generic/SystemUUID`.
  Reboot and Apple services should work.

* If they don't, follow [this in-depth guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/universal/iservices.html). It goes deeper into ROM, clearing NVRAM, clearing Keychain (missing this step might cause major issues), and much more.
